dist determines the distance limit for the actor to check for players in. If dist is set to 0, the distance limit will be infinite.
allaround? determines whether the actor will look all around itself for players or just within 90Â° of the direction it is currently facing.
tracer? determines whether to use actor.tracer instead of actor.target. This is useful for homing missiles such as the Deton, since missiles set their target to the Object who shot them and thus cannot harm it.

dist defaults to 0 if not given, while allaround? and tracer both default to false if not given.
